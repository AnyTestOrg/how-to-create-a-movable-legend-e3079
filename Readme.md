# How to create a movable legend


<p>This example illustrates how to make a chart legend movable, so that an end-user can change its position via drag & drop at runtime.<br>To accomplish this, the chart's Legend item is rendered to an image and linked to an <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/7858/Controls-and-Libraries/Chart-Control/Fundamentals/Chart-Elements/Annotations">Image Annotation</a>. The annotation's <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.XtraCharts.Annotation.RuntimeMoving.property">RuntimeMoving</a> option isÂ enabled to make the annotation element movable.</p>
